## Why

The site captures leads through a standard contact form and newsletter signup, but there's no interactive, high-value lead magnet that qualifies prospects while demonstrating Number6's AI capabilities. An AI Readiness Assessment chatbot serves dual purposes: it generates qualified leads with rich context (company size, maturity, pain points) and it showcases the agency's ability to build and deploy conversational AI agents. By using a live OpenAI-powered agent rather than a scripted flow, the experience feels genuinely intelligent and adaptive, reinforcing Number6's credibility as an AI agency.

## What Changes

- New `/assessment` page as a full dedicated page with an introduction section at the top and an embedded chat window below (not a dialog or popup)
- Live conversational AI agent powered by OpenAI, deployed as a separate Python backend service
- The agent guides users through AI readiness questions with natural branching, contextual follow-ups, and adaptive responses
- Lead capture woven into the conversation (name, email, company, role)
- Assessment scoring across four dimensions with a personalized report generated by the agent
- Report delivery on-screen and via email (Web3Forms)
- Conversation persistence via localStorage so users can navigate away and resume where they left off
- Clear time estimate (~5 minutes) communicated to users upfront
- New homepage CTA and header navigation link to drive traffic to the assessment
- Design document for the chatbot UI and page layout

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- `assessment-chatbot`: Conversational UI component with message bubbles, typing indicators, quick-reply buttons, and free-text input. Handles rendering, localStorage persistence, and communication with the backend agent API.
- `assessment-agent`: Python backend service (in `agent/` subfolder) using OpenAI that manages the conversation flow, scoring logic, question branching, lead capture, and report generation. Deployed independently from the Astro static site. Uses `uv` for Python dependency management.
- `assessment-report`: On-screen report rendering with score visualizations and email delivery via Web3Forms. Report data is generated by the backend agent and rendered by the frontend.
- `assessment-page`: The `/assessment` route as a full dedicated page with introduction section, embedded chat window, time estimate, SEO metadata, header nav link, and homepage CTA integration.

### Modified Capabilities

_(none, all new capabilities)_

## Impact

- **New page**: `src/pages/assessment.astro` (full dedicated page, not a dialog)
- **New components**: React chatbot components in `src/components/sections/assessment/`
- **New backend**: `agent/` subfolder with Python FastAPI service using OpenAI, managed with `uv`
- **Layout**: Uses existing `BaseLayout.astro`
- **Dependencies (frontend)**: No new package dependencies (existing React/Tailwind stack)
- **Dependencies (backend)**: Python 3.12+, FastAPI, openai, asyncpg or sqlalchemy[asyncio], uv for dependency management
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for conversation storage, lead data, and assessment results
- **Infrastructure**: Backend agent deployed separately (needs its own hosting + Postgres instance)
- **Navigation**: Header update to include assessment link
- **Homepage**: New CTA section to promote the assessment
- **Browser storage**: localStorage for conversation persistence
- **Design**: Design document for the full assessment page and chatbot UI
