## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Report data from agent
The report data SHALL be generated by the backend agent and delivered as a structured JSON payload in the response metadata when `is_report: true`. The frontend SHALL NOT compute scores or generate recommendations. The report payload from the agent SHALL include: overall score (0-100) and tier, each dimension's score/tier/analysis text, 3-5 personalized recommendations with titles and descriptions, and a summary paragraph.

#### Scenario: Report data received from agent
- **WHEN** the agent sends a response with `is_report: true`
- **THEN** the metadata contains a `report` object with overall score, dimension scores, analysis, and recommendations

#### Scenario: Frontend renders agent-provided data
- **WHEN** the report view renders
- **THEN** all scores, analysis text, and recommendations come from the agent's report payload (no client-side computation)

### Requirement: On-screen report display
After the agent delivers the report, the chat interface SHALL transition to a full report view within the same page layout. The report SHALL display: an overall score with tier label and summary paragraph, a visual score breakdown showing all four dimensions, individual dimension cards with score, tier, and analysis text, and personalized recommendations. The transition SHALL include a brief "Generating your report..." animation (1-2 seconds).

#### Scenario: Report generation animation
- **WHEN** the agent sends the report response
- **THEN** a "Generating your report..." animation plays for 1-2 seconds before the report renders

#### Scenario: Report displays all sections
- **WHEN** the report view renders
- **THEN** it shows: overall score, dimension visual breakdown, individual dimension cards, and recommendations

#### Scenario: Report replaces chat
- **WHEN** the report is generated
- **THEN** the report view replaces the chat interface within the same page section

### Requirement: Dimension score visualization
Each dimension score SHALL be displayed as a horizontal progress bar with the terracotta fill color proportional to the score (0-100%). The bar SHALL show the numeric score and tier label. All four dimension bars SHALL be stacked vertically for easy comparison. The overall score SHALL be displayed prominently at the top as a large number with the tier label.

#### Scenario: Score bars render correctly
- **WHEN** the report displays dimension scores
- **THEN** each dimension shows a labeled horizontal bar filled proportionally to the score with the numeric value and tier

#### Scenario: Overall score prominent display
- **WHEN** the report renders
- **THEN** the overall composite score is displayed in large text (Space Grotesk, 64px) with its tier label below

### Requirement: Score tiers
Scores SHALL map to tiers: 0-30 "Early Stage", 31-55 "Building Foundations", 56-75 "Progressing", 76-100 "Advanced". Tier labels SHALL be displayed alongside each dimension score and the overall score.

#### Scenario: Tier displayed with score
- **WHEN** a dimension has a score of 62
- **THEN** the tier "Progressing" is displayed alongside the score

#### Scenario: Tier boundary accuracy
- **WHEN** dimension scores are at boundary values (30, 31, 55, 56, 75, 76)
- **THEN** each maps to the correct tier

### Requirement: Personalized recommendations
The report SHALL display 3-5 recommendations as provided by the agent. Each recommendation SHALL render as a card with: a title, a 2-3 sentence explanation, and a relevance tag mapping to a Number6 service area. Recommendations SHALL be visually distinct from the dimension analysis cards.

#### Scenario: Recommendations render
- **WHEN** the report displays recommendations
- **THEN** each recommendation shows as a card with title, explanation, and service tag

#### Scenario: Recommendation count
- **WHEN** the report renders
- **THEN** between 3 and 5 recommendation cards are displayed

### Requirement: Report CTA section
The report SHALL end with a call-to-action section that includes: a headline (e.g., "Ready to take the next step?"), body text explaining how Number6 can help based on their results, a primary CTA button "Book a free discovery call" linking to `/contact`, and a secondary CTA "Explore our services" linking to `/services`. The CTA section SHALL use the terracotta background style consistent with the site's Final CTA pattern.

#### Scenario: CTA section renders
- **WHEN** the report view displays
- **THEN** a CTA section appears at the bottom with a primary button to `/contact` and secondary button to `/services`

### Requirement: Email report delivery
Upon receiving the report from the agent, the frontend SHALL submit a summary of the assessment results to Web3Forms. The submission SHALL include: user name, email, company, role, overall score and tier, each dimension score and tier, and the recommendations. The Web3Forms subject line SHALL be "Your AI Readiness Assessment Results". The submission SHALL use a dedicated Web3Forms access key (separate from the contact form key).

#### Scenario: Email submission on report
- **WHEN** the report is received and the user provided a valid email
- **THEN** the frontend submits the assessment results to Web3Forms

#### Scenario: Email submission failure
- **WHEN** the Web3Forms submission fails
- **THEN** the on-screen report still displays normally and a subtle message indicates the email could not be sent with a fallback to contact hello@number6.ai

#### Scenario: Email confirmation shown
- **WHEN** the email submission succeeds
- **THEN** the report view shows a confirmation message: "We've sent a copy of this report to [email]"

### Requirement: Report dark theme
The report view SHALL use the same dark theme as the chatbot interface. Score bars SHALL use terracotta fill on dark backgrounds. Dimension cards SHALL use `#1A1A1A` background with `#333` borders. Text SHALL be `#FFFFFF` for headings and `#E0E0E0` for body. The CTA section SHALL use the terracotta background.

#### Scenario: Report visual consistency
- **WHEN** the report renders
- **THEN** all colors, fonts, and spacing match the dark theme used in the chatbot and other dark sections of the site

### Requirement: Report scroll and layout
The report SHALL render within the same page section as the chatbot (replacing it). On desktop, the report SHALL have a maximum width of 720px centered on the page. On mobile, it SHALL be full-width with 20px horizontal padding. Each section of the report SHALL have clear visual separation.

#### Scenario: Report layout on desktop
- **WHEN** the report renders on desktop
- **THEN** it is centered with max-width 720px

#### Scenario: Report layout on mobile
- **WHEN** the report renders on mobile
- **THEN** it is full-width with 20px horizontal padding

### Requirement: Share results capability
The report view SHALL include a "Share your results" section with a "Copy link" button. The link SHALL encode the overall score and tier in URL search parameters so the page can render a simplified public results summary when accessed via the shared link. The shared view SHALL NOT include personal information (name, email, company).

#### Scenario: Copy results link
- **WHEN** the user clicks "Copy link"
- **THEN** a URL with encoded score data is copied to the clipboard and a "Copied!" confirmation appears

#### Scenario: Shared link renders summary
- **WHEN** someone visits the assessment page with score parameters in the URL
- **THEN** a simplified results summary displays showing the overall score and dimension breakdown without personal data
