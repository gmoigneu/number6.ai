        We started number6<br />because we were tired<br />of the AI hype gap.

        On one side: breathless headlines about AI changing everything. On the other: real businesses (the kind that actually make the economy run) struggling to figure out what any of it means for them.
      </p>
      <p class="font-body text-base text-foreground leading-[1.7]">
        We've spent our careers building technology and deploying it where it actually has to work. Between us, we've worked across web development, cloud infrastructure, developer advocacy, and AI engineering. In companies of every size, on both sides of the Atlantic.
      </p>
      <p class="font-body text-base text-foreground leading-[1.7]">
        What we kept seeing was the same pattern: organizations that wanted to use AI but didn't know where to start. Teams that had tried tools but couldn't make them stick. The opportunity was obvious, but the path to it wasn't.
      </p>
      <p class="font-body text-base text-foreground leading-[1.7]">
        So we built number6.ai to be the AI partner we wished existed. One that's straightforward about what AI can and can't do, publishes what it costs, and sticks around until every solution actually gets used after we leave the room.
      </p>
      <p class="font-body text-base text-foreground leading-[1.7]">
        We're not a big consultancy. We're not going to hand you a strategy deck and wave goodbye. We're two experienced people who sit down with your team, understand your work, and help you do it better with AI. Then we make sure you can keep going without us.
      </p>
      <p class="font-body text-base text-foreground leading-[1.7]">
        That's it. We don't have a "proprietary AI platform." We have experience, opinions, and a track record of making this stuff work for real companies.
