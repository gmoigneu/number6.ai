        We started number6<br />because we were tired<br />of the AI hype gap.

        On one side: breathless headlines about AI changing everything. On the other: real businesses — the kind that actually make the economy run — struggling to figure out what any of it means for them.
      </p>
      <p class="font-body text-base text-foreground leading-[1.7]">
        We've spent our careers building technology, deploying it in the real world, and teaching people how to use it. Between us, we've worked across web development, cloud infrastructure, developer advocacy, and AI engineering — in companies of every size, on both sides of the Atlantic.
      </p>
      <p class="font-body text-base text-foreground leading-[1.7]">
        What we kept seeing was the same pattern: organizations that wanted to use AI but didn't know where to start. Teams that had tried tools but couldn't make them stick. Leaders who sensed the opportunity but couldn't separate the signal from the noise.
      </p>
      <p class="font-body text-base text-foreground leading-[1.7]">
        So we built number6.ai to be the AI partner we wished existed — one that's honest about what AI can and can't do, transparent about what it costs, and committed to making sure every solution actually gets used after we leave the room.
      </p>
      <p class="font-body text-base text-foreground leading-[1.7]">
        We're not a big consultancy. We're not going to hand you a strategy deck and wave goodbye. We're two experienced people who sit down with your team, understand your work, and help you do it better with AI. Then we teach you how to keep going without us.
      </p>
      <p class="font-body text-base text-foreground leading-[1.7]">
        That's it. No mystique. No "proprietary AI platform." Just expertise, honesty, and a genuine investment in your success.
