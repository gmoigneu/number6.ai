      <h3 class="font-heading text-[28px] font-bold text-foreground tracking-[-1px]">Why two people?</h3>
      <p class="font-body text-base text-muted-foreground leading-[1.6]">
        Can two people really deliver all this?<br />Here's our honest answer.
      </p>

    <div class="flex flex-col gap-6 flex-1">
      <p class="font-body text-base text-foreground leading-[1.7]">
        For workshops, training, strategy, and advisory, two senior people are all you need, and arguably better than a larger team. You get undivided attention, consistent quality, and zero handoffs between "the person who sold it" and "the person who does it."
      </p>
      <p class="font-body text-base text-foreground leading-[1.7]">
        For complex builds (custom agents, RAG systems), we work with a curated network of trusted specialists we've vetted through years of professional collaboration. They work under our direct supervision, to our standards. You always have one of us as your single point of contact.
      </p>
      <p class="font-body text-base text-foreground leading-[1.7]">
        The boutique model isn't a limitation. It's a deliberate choice. It means we take on fewer clients, deliver higher quality, and actually care about every engagement because our reputation is on the line with every single one.
