Here's a pattern we keep seeing. A company buys AI tools. Rolls them out to the team. Sends an email with login credentials and maybe a link to a YouTube tutorial. Three months later, adoption is at 15% and the CFO is asking why they're paying for 50 licenses nobody uses.

The tool wasn't the problem. The training was.

Or rather, the complete absence of training was.

## The number everyone should know

According to a 2024 McKinsey survey, 62% of organizations cite lack of employee skills and training as the top barrier to adopting AI. Not cost. Not data quality. Not privacy concerns. Training.

That number has held roughly steady for two years. Companies keep buying AI tools and keep skipping the part where they teach people how to use them. Then they report, with apparent surprise, that adoption is low.

We'll be honest: this one frustrates us. The fix isn't complicated. It isn't even expensive. It just requires deciding that training matters before you hand out subscriptions.

## What "AI literacy" actually means

When we say "AI literacy," we don't mean turning your accounting team into machine learning engineers. We mean giving people enough understanding to use AI tools well and enough judgment to know when not to.

For non-technical employees, that breaks down into a few things.

First, understanding what AI tools can and can't do. Not the theoretical version. The practical one. "This tool is good at drafting first versions. It's bad at knowing whether the content is accurate. Check everything." That takes about 30 minutes to teach well.

Then there's prompting. This is the skill that makes the biggest difference in daily use. The gap between a bad prompt and a good one is enormous, and most people have never been shown what a good one looks like. It's like handing someone a spreadsheet without teaching them formulas.

People also need to learn what AI mistakes look like in practice. These tools sound confident even when they're wrong. "Hallucination" isn't just a concept. It's a specific pattern you can learn to spot. But it takes examples and practice.

And finally, judgment: when to use AI and when not to. Some tasks get faster with AI. Others get worse. Your team needs a framework for deciding.

The US Department of Labor published an AI Literacy Framework in late 2024 that maps this out across four dimensions: knowledge, skills, interaction, and ethics. It's designed for workforce development rather than academia, which makes it more useful than most frameworks we've seen. We use a modified version of it as a starting point when designing training, adapted to what the team actually does day to day.

## What a four-week program looks like

Four weeks sounds like a lot. It isn't. We're talking about four to six hours of structured time per week, not full-time study.

The first week is foundations. What AI tools do, what they don't, how to evaluate output. Everyone gets hands-on time with the tools they'll actually be using. The goal by Friday: every person on the team has used AI for a real work task (not a toy example) and seen it produce something useful.

Week two is where the biggest gains happen. Structured prompting techniques. How to give the AI context, constraints, and examples. How to iterate when the first output misses. People practice on their actual work: their emails, their reports, their processes. Most people go from "I typed a question and got a weird answer" to "I can get a solid first draft of almost anything I write" in about five days.

Week three shifts to workflow integration. The team starts building AI into their real processes. Which parts of daily work benefit? Where does AI create more problems than it solves? This week is about experimentation and honest assessment. Some things work. Some don't.

The final week covers judgment and review. Catching AI mistakes. Fact-checking output efficiently. Practical governance: what data should and shouldn't go into AI tools, how to handle confidential information, what the company's AI use policy is.

At the end of four weeks, you don't have a team of AI experts. You have a team that can actually use the tools you're paying for. That's the bar, and most companies never clear it.

## Why companies skip training

The objection we hear most often: "It'll slow us down." Yes, for four weeks. Then you gain back months of productive tool use that you'd otherwise lose to low adoption and frustrated employees.

The second most common: "People will figure it out themselves." Some will. Most won't. The ones who don't will quietly stop using the tools and never tell you about it. You'll see it in the adoption numbers six months later, if you're measuring at all.

And then there's "training is expensive." A well-run program for a team of 20 costs less than three months of unused AI tool subscriptions. The training pays for itself before the quarter is over.

I get why companies skip it, though. Training feels like overhead. It doesn't produce a deliverable. You can't point to a dashboard and say "training did this" the way you can with a new software deployment. Someone has to own it, plan it, run it, and most small businesses don't have a training function.

But the alternative is paying for tools your team doesn't use. We've watched this play out enough times to feel strongly about it.

## The catch (because there's always a catch)

Training isn't a one-time event. AI tools change constantly. Models get updated. New features appear. A team trained in January may need a refresh by July.

Refresher training is much lighter than the initial program, though. Once people have the fundamentals, updating them on new capabilities takes hours, not weeks.

The harder truth: **training only works if leadership takes it seriously.** If the CEO sends the team to a workshop and then never asks about AI use in practice, the training fades. If managers don't model AI use themselves, the team gets the message that it's optional.

We've seen teams where the training stuck and teams where it didn't. The difference was almost never the quality of the program. It was whether someone in leadership kept the conversation going afterward.

## What good training actually costs

For a team of 10 to 30 people, a well-designed AI training program (needs assessment, customized curriculum, hands-on workshops, follow-up support) typically runs between $3,000 and $10,000. The range depends on depth, duration, and how much customization you need.

That's less than most companies spend on a single AI tool subscription for a year. And unlike the subscription, training compounds. A team that knows how to prompt well today will adapt faster to new tools tomorrow.

For context, the average enterprise spends $1,200 to $1,800 per employee per year on general training and development (Association for Talent Development, 2024). Adding AI literacy to that budget isn't a leap. It's a reallocation.

## Where to start if you've been skipping this

You don't need to build a training program from scratch.

Pick five people on your team. A mix: one skeptic, one enthusiast, a couple in the middle. Give them structured training over two to three weeks. Let them become your internal AI champions.

Then have those five people teach everyone else. Peer-to-peer learning works surprisingly well for AI skills because the examples come from actual work, not hypothetical scenarios.

If that feels too informal, bring in outside help. But start with the principle: **train before you buy, or at least alongside the buying.** The worst sequence is buy first, train never.

The 62% of organizations struggling with AI adoption aren't facing a technology problem. They're facing a training problem.

You teach people.
