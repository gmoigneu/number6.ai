    <h2>2. How We Use Cookies</h2>
    <p>We use cookies for the following purposes:</p>

    <p><strong>2.1 Strictly Necessary Cookies</strong></p>
    <p>These cookies are essential for the Site to function. They cannot be disabled.</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>

    <p><strong>2.2 Analytics Cookies</strong></p>
    <p>These cookies help us understand how visitors interact with the Site: which pages are popular, how people navigate, and where they drop off. This data is aggregated and anonymized; we do not use analytics cookies to identify individual visitors.</p>

      <p>We are committed to privacy-respecting analytics. If we use Google Analytics, we enable IP anonymization and disable data sharing with Google for advertising purposes. We may use or switch to privacy-first alternatives like Plausible Analytics, which does not use cookies at all.</p>
