AI that works. For people who work.

We help businesses understand and build with AI. Straight talk, no buzzwords. From first steps to custom AI agents, we're here until your team can run it without us.

## The problem

AI is everywhere. Clarity isn't. Most businesses know AI matters, but they don't know where to start or what to trust. Every vendor is promising the moon.

## What we do

Whether you're just getting started or ready to build something custom, we work with what you've got.

**Learn (AI Foundations & Training):** Workshops, coaching, and team training that take your team from "what is this?" to actually using it. For leaders who want to understand. For teams who want to do.

**Plan (AI Strategy & Readiness):** Our number6 AI Readiness Index evaluates your business across six dimensions and gives you a prioritized roadmap, not a 90-page report that gathers dust.

**Build (Custom AI Solutions):** From intelligent agents with memory and context to RAG-powered knowledge bases that actually know your business. We build it, deploy it, and make sure it holds up on a Tuesday afternoon.

**Grow (Ongoing AI Partnership):** A fractional AI partner who knows your business and monitors your AI tools. Like having a Chief AI Officer for a fraction of the full-time cost.

## How we work

1. **We listen.** Every engagement starts with understanding your business and your goals. Not with a sales pitch.
2. **We plan (honestly).** We identify where AI will genuinely help, and where it won't. You get a clear, prioritized plan with real costs and real timelines.
3. **We build and teach.** We build alongside your team and train them as we go. When we leave, the solution keeps working and your people know how to run it.

## Why number6?

- We publish our prices. In a market where almost every AI consultancy hides their rates, we believe you deserve to know what things cost before the first call.
- We'll tell you when you don't need AI. Some problems are better solved with a spreadsheet, a process change, or a good hire.
- You get us, not a junior team. We're a senior two-person team. When you hire number6, you work directly with the people who built and deployed the solution.
- Two continents, your timezone. Based in Houston, TX and Manchester, UK.
- We teach your team to fish. Training is baked into every project.

## Who it's for

Our clients are typically companies with 10 to 500 people. Large enough to benefit from AI, nimble enough to actually adopt it.

- Professional services: law firms, accounting practices, consultancies
- Marketing and creative: content, campaigns, client workflows
- Operations-heavy: logistics, manufacturing, field services
- Tech-forward SMBs: SaaS companies, startups, digital businesses

## Results

- 5 to 10 hours saved per employee per week
- 30 to 90 days from call to working solution
- 8 to 25 team members trained per engagement
- 80%+ clients expand to additional projects

Two people, two continents, one mission: practical AI consulting that actually works.

## Our story

We started number6 because we were tired of the AI hype gap. On one side: breathless headlines about AI changing everything. On the other: real businesses struggling to figure out what any of it means for them.

We've spent our careers building technology and deploying it where it actually has to work. Between us, we've worked across web development, cloud infrastructure, developer advocacy, and AI engineering. In companies of every size, on both sides of the Atlantic.

What we kept seeing was the same pattern: organizations that wanted to use AI but didn't know where to start. Teams that had tried tools but couldn't make them stick.

So we built number6.ai to be the AI partner we wished existed. One that's straightforward about what AI can and can't do, publishes what it costs, and sticks around until every solution actually gets used.

We're not a big consultancy. We're two experienced people who sit down with your team, understand your work, and help you do it better with AI. Then we make sure you can keep going without us.

## Our team

### Guillaume Moigneu (Houston, TX)

20+ years building the web. Started in developer advocacy and web engineering, then moved into cloud platforms and infrastructure before going deep on AI. Now Field CTO at Upsun. Spoken at conferences on four continents.

Expertise: AI strategy, agentic AI development, performance engineering, developer experience.

### Greg Qualls (Manchester, UK)

20+ years working with businesses to transform how they operate. Spent the last several years going deep on AI products, systems, and technology, helping organizations cut through the noise and implement solutions that actually move the needle.

Expertise: AI product strategy, AI implementation, systems thinking, process optimization, change management.

### Why two people?

For workshops, training, strategy, and advisory, two senior people are all you need. You get undivided attention, consistent quality, and zero handoffs. For complex builds, we work with a curated network of trusted specialists under our direct supervision.

Being small is a deliberate choice. We take on fewer clients and deliver higher quality because our reputation is on the line with every single engagement.

## What we believe

1. **Honesty over sales.** If AI isn't the right solution, we'll tell you. We'd rather lose a deal than sell you something that doesn't work.
2. **Results over impressions.** We measure success by hours saved and teams that actually use what we built.
3. **We want you to outgrow us.** Every engagement includes training. Our goal is for you to need us less over time.
4. **You can see our prices right now.** Our prices are published. Our process is documented. Our recommendations are explained in plain language.
5. **People over technology.** AI is a tool. Your people are the strategy. We design every solution around the humans who'll use it.

			"Common questions about AI consulting, training, strategy, pricing, and how number6.ai works",
		markdown: `# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about working with number6: how we work and what things cost.

## What is AI consulting?

AI consulting means working with an external expert to help your business understand, adopt, and benefit from artificial intelligence. At number6, that typically means one of four things: training your team to use AI tools effectively, assessing where AI will genuinely help your business, building a custom AI solution for a specific workflow, or acting as an ongoing AI partner.

## What is the number6 AI Readiness Index?

The number6 AI Readiness Index is our proprietary evaluation framework. It assesses a business across six dimensions (people, process, data, technology, leadership, and culture) and produces a prioritised roadmap. Unlike generic AI readiness reports, the output is a clear action plan with real costs, timelines, and priorities. A typical assessment takes two to three weeks.

## Do you publish your prices?

Yes. We publish our packages and pricing openly on the site. Most AI consultancies hide their rates and make you sit through a discovery call before revealing costs. You should know what things cost before the first conversation.

## How long does a typical engagement take?

Most clients see a working solution within 30 to 90 days of the initial discovery call. AI Foundations training can be delivered in a single day or spread across a few weeks. Strategy assessments typically take two to three weeks. Custom AI builds depend on complexity but rarely exceed 90 days for an initial deployment.

## How does the process work?

Every engagement starts with a free 30-minute discovery call where we listen to your situation. We then produce an honest plan that identifies where AI will genuinely help and where it won't, with real costs and timelines. We build alongside your team and train them as we go. When we leave, the solution keeps working and your people know how to run it.

## Do you work with small and mid-size businesses?

Yes. Our typical clients have between 10 and 500 employees. Large enough to benefit from AI, nimble enough to actually adopt it. We focus specifically on SMBs because they move faster, make decisions more quickly, and tend to get more value from AI implementations than large enterprises with lengthy procurement cycles.

## Where are you based? Do you work internationally?

We are based in Houston, TX (Americas) and Manchester, UK (Europe). We serve clients across the US, UK, and EU with overlapping hours that cover most business timezones. The work is predominantly remote, with on-site options available.

## What's the difference between AI training and AI strategy?

AI training focuses on your team's ability to use AI tools day-to-day: workshops, coaching, and hands-on practice that take people from "what is this?" to actually using it. AI strategy focuses on your business's readiness to adopt AI at a structural level, covering the right opportunities, the right tools, and the right order to pursue them. Most clients benefit from both.

## Will AI replace our employees?

In most SMB contexts, AI replaces tasks, not people. The businesses that get the most from AI are the ones that retrain their teams to work alongside it rather than treating it as a headcount-reduction tool. We train your team as part of every project because the goal is AI adoption, not AI dependence.

## Do we need to be technical to work with you?

No. We explain everything in plain English. You do not need to understand how large language models work to benefit from them. Our job is to translate between what the technology can do and what your business actually needs.

## What industries do you work with?

We work across professional services (law firms, accountancies, consultancies), marketing and creative agencies, operations-heavy businesses (logistics, manufacturing, field services), and tech-forward SMBs. If your team does repetitive knowledge work, we can likely help. AI doesn't care about industry verticals.

## What is a RAG-powered knowledge base?

RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. A RAG-powered knowledge base is an AI system that can search and reason over your specific documents, policies, or data, not just generic internet knowledge. Instead of staff searching through shared drives or asking colleagues, they ask the system and it retrieves the right answer from your actual content.

## What does "Fractional Chief AI Officer" mean?

A Fractional Chief AI Officer is an ongoing AI partnership where we act as your embedded AI expert without the full-time cost. We monitor your AI tools, keep your team up to date as the technology changes, and help you identify new opportunities as your business grows. It's for businesses that want AI expertise on tap without a full-time hire.

## Do you build custom tools or use off-the-shelf AI products?

Both, depending on what solves the problem. Off-the-shelf AI tools (ChatGPT, Notion AI, Copilot, etc.) are often the right answer. They're faster to deploy and cost less. Custom builds make sense when a specific workflow needs automation that no existing tool covers, or when your business has unique data that gives a custom system a significant advantage.

## Why do most AI projects fail?

The most common failure mode is starting with "we need to use AI" instead of "we have a problem that might be solvable with AI." Other frequent causes: skipping baseline measurement so you can't prove ROI, choosing tools based on hype rather than fit, and not involving end users until it's too late.

## How do you measure success?

We track actual usage and time data with clients during and after deployment. Across our engagements, businesses that complete a number6 AI implementation typically save five to ten hours per employee per week on the targeted process. We define success before we start: measurable outcomes agreed in advance.

## What happens after the engagement ends?

At the end of every engagement, your team knows how to run the solution we built. We don't create dependency. If you want ongoing support, our AI Partnership model provides that, but it's an option, not a requirement. 80% of clients return for additional projects after their first engagement.

## How are you different from other AI consultancies?

Three things stand out. First, we publish our prices. Second, we'll tell you honestly when AI isn't the right answer for your problem. Third, you work directly with the senior people who built your solution. No junior handoff, no account managers in the middle.

## What size team do you typically train?

Typical engagements train between 8 and 25 team members. Sessions can be delivered as a full-day workshop, half-day deep dives by department, or a series of shorter coaching sessions spread over several weeks.

## How do I get started?

Book a free 30-minute discovery call. No sales pressure, no pitch deck. We'll ask about your business and what you're trying to solve, and tell you honestly whether we can help and what it would cost.
