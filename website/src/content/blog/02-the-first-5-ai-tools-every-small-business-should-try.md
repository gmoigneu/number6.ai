Every week someone asks us what AI tools their team should actually be using. The honest answer depends on your business, but after working with dozens of small and mid-sized companies, we keep seeing the same handful of tools prove their worth.

Here are the five we recommend most often, with honest trade-offs for each. No affiliate links. No sponsorships.

## 1. ChatGPT (by OpenAI)

The one everyone's heard of, and for good reason. ChatGPT is the most versatile general-purpose AI tool available right now. If your team is only going to try one, start here.

It's strongest at writing: drafting emails, summarizing documents, brainstorming ideas, creating outlines, rewriting text for different audiences. It's also surprisingly capable at analyzing data if you upload spreadsheets or CSVs. The Plus tier includes image generation and web browsing, which means it can do basic research for you.

The free tier is usable but limited. You'll hit usage caps during busy hours and won't get the latest model. Plus ($20/month per user) is where it starts being genuinely useful for daily work. The Team tier ($25-30/month per user) adds admin controls and the important promise that your data won't be used for training, which matters if your team handles anything confidential.

The catch with ChatGPT is consistency. Ask it the same question twice and you'll sometimes get different answers. It's also prone to hallucination, confidently stating things that aren't true, especially around specific facts, dates, and numbers. Your team needs to learn to verify anything that matters.

Good for: almost everyone. Start with your marketing team, operations lead, and anyone who writes a lot of emails or reports.

## 2. Claude (by Anthropic)

Claude is the one we reach for most often ourselves. I'll say it plainly: I think it's the best tool for work that requires careful reading and nuanced writing.

Give it a 50-page document and ask it to summarize the key points, find contradictions, or compare it against another document. It handles this kind of work better than any other tool we've tested. The writing quality tends to be more natural and less obviously AI-generated than ChatGPT, which matters if you're producing customer-facing content.

Claude also tends to be more cautious. Where ChatGPT will confidently answer a question it shouldn't, Claude is more likely to say "I'm not sure about this" or flag potential issues. For business use, we consider that a feature, not a bug.

Pricing is similar to ChatGPT. The Pro plan runs $20/month per user. Team pricing starts at $25/month per user with admin controls and privacy guarantees. The free tier exists but is pretty limited.

The trade-off: Claude can't browse the web, which means no real-time research. No image generation either. And it's less flexible than ChatGPT for quick, casual tasks. Think specialist versus generalist. If your work involves lots of long documents, contracts, or detailed writing, Claude is worth the trade-off. If you need a do-everything tool, ChatGPT is more versatile.

## 3. Microsoft Copilot

If your company runs on Microsoft 365 (Word, Excel, Outlook, Teams), Copilot is worth a serious look. The reason is simple: it works inside the tools your team already uses every day.

Copilot can draft emails in Outlook, summarize Teams meetings, generate first drafts in Word, and help with formulas in Excel. It doesn't do any one thing better than ChatGPT or Claude. The value is that your team doesn't have to switch to a separate app and copy-paste things back and forth. That friction matters more than people think. We've seen teams abandon objectively better AI tools because they required an extra step in the workflow.

Now, the pricing. Microsoft 365 Copilot runs $30/user/month on top of your existing Microsoft 365 subscription. For a 50-person company, that's $18,000 a year. Don't give it to everyone. Start with 5-10 power users who live in Office apps all day and measure whether it saves them enough time to justify the cost.

The output quality is a step below ChatGPT or Claude for complex writing or analysis. It's a convenience play, not a quality play. And the setup requires your IT admin to configure it properly, which isn't always straightforward. If you use Google Workspace instead of Microsoft, skip to the next section.

Good for: power users of Microsoft 365, especially people who spend hours in Outlook and Excel. Not worth it for light Microsoft users.

## 4. Google Gemini

Gemini fills the same role for Google Workspace shops that Copilot fills for Microsoft ones. If your company lives in Gmail, Docs, and Sheets, this is the integration play for you.

The standalone Gemini app is free and decent for basic tasks. The real product for businesses is Gemini for Google Workspace, which plugs into Gmail, Docs, and Sheets. It drafts emails, summarizes threads, helps with spreadsheet formulas, and generates documents.

Google's pricing is friendlier than Microsoft's: the Business plan is $20/user/month as a Workspace add-on. The Enterprise tier is $30/user/month with added security and compliance features.

We'll be honest: the writing quality lags behind both ChatGPT and Claude. Gemini tends to produce blander, more generic text, and it's less reliable for analyzing long documents. The convenience of having AI built into Gmail and Docs is genuinely valuable if that's where your team spends their day. Just don't expect the same output quality you'd get from a dedicated tool.

There's also Google's track record with products. They've killed popular services before (Google Reader, Inbox, Hangouts, the list goes on). We don't think Gemini is going anywhere given how central AI is to Google's strategy, but it's worth knowing.

If you use neither Google nor Microsoft heavily, skip both Copilot and Gemini. Focus on ChatGPT or Claude instead.

## 5. Otter.ai (meeting transcription and notes)

This solves a different, very specific problem: taking notes in meetings. And honestly, it's the tool that gets the most "why didn't we start using this sooner" reactions from our clients.

Otter.ai joins your Zoom, Google Meet, or Teams calls and transcribes everything in real time. After the meeting, it generates a summary with action items. Your team can search through past meetings by keyword. Someone missed the meeting? They read the summary in five minutes instead of scheduling a catch-up call.

The free tier gives you 300 minutes of transcription per month, which is enough to test it properly. The Pro plan ($8.33/month billed annually) gives you 1,200 minutes. The Business plan ($20/user/month) adds team management and CRM integrations.

Worth knowing about alternatives: Fireflies.ai does similar things with slightly different integrations and pricing. Microsoft Teams has built-in transcription if you're already paying for Copilot. And Zoom's AI Companion now includes meeting summaries at no extra cost on paid plans. Test a couple and see which one fits your setup.

The honest downside: transcription accuracy drops with heavy accents, background noise, or people talking over each other. The summaries sometimes miss nuance or misattribute who said what. And if your meetings involve sensitive topics (HR discussions, legal matters, financials), check the data handling policies carefully. Transcripts are stored on their servers, which may not fly depending on your industry.

Good for: anyone who spends more than a few hours a week in meetings. Start with project managers and team leads.

## Before you buy anything

A few things we tell every client before they start signing up for subscriptions.

Start with free tiers. Every tool on this list has one. Give your team two weeks to experiment before committing any money. Two weeks is enough to know whether people will actually use it.

Don't buy for everyone at once. Pick 3-5 team members who are curious and willing to learn. Let them become your internal experts. They'll teach everyone else eventually, and they'll give you a much more honest assessment of what works than any vendor demo will.

**Set a check-in date.** Put something on the calendar 30 days after you start using any new tool. Ask two questions: Is anyone actually using this? Has it saved measurable time? If the answer to either is no, cancel it and try something else. Too many businesses keep paying for tools nobody touches because nobody ever asked the question.

Watch the per-user costs. A $20/month tool doesn't sound like much until you multiply it by headcount and by 12 months. Be ruthless about who actually needs paid access. Most teams find that 20-30% of employees benefit enough from paid AI tools to justify the cost. The rest can use free tiers or do without.

The tool is the easy part. The hard part is getting your team comfortable enough to use it regularly. That means training, real examples from their actual work, and explicit permission to experiment. Budget time for that, not just dollars for software.
