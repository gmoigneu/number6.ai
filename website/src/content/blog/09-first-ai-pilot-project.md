Your competitor just announced they're "using AI across the organization." You read the blog post and it was 800 words of buzzwords with zero specifics. But the pressure is real. Your board, your team, your customers are all asking: what are we doing with AI?

The temptation is to go big. Buy a platform. Roll it out company-wide. Transform the business. That's also how most AI projects fail. They're too broad, too expensive, too disconnected from any specific problem, and after six months, nobody can tell you what changed.

Here's what works instead: start with one thing. A pilot project. Two weeks. One workflow. Real measurement. Then decide.

## Picking the right use case

The use case makes or breaks your pilot. Pick the wrong one, and you'll conclude that "AI doesn't work for us" when the truth is that AI didn't work for that particular problem. We've seen this happen enough times that we now spend more time helping businesses pick the right use case than actually building the pilot.

**The best pilot use cases share four traits:**

They're **repetitive**. Someone on your team does this task the same way, over and over, every week. Processing incoming support requests. Summarizing meeting notes. Categorizing expense reports. Drafting first versions of standard documents. The more repetitive, the better.

They're **data-heavy** (or at least text-heavy). AI is good at reading, summarizing, comparing, and generating text. If the task involves working with documents, emails, spreadsheets, or written records, AI has something to work with.

They're **low-risk**. Your first pilot should not be something where an AI mistake costs you a client, a contract, or a compliance issue. Pick a task where a wrong answer means someone spends five minutes correcting it, not five months fixing the fallout.

They're **measurable**. You need to be able to compare "before AI" and "after AI" with actual numbers. Hours spent per week. Error rates. Turnaround time. If you can't measure it, you can't evaluate whether the pilot worked.

### Use cases that work well for first pilots

- Summarizing meeting notes and extracting action items
- Drafting first versions of emails, reports, or proposals that a human then edits
- Categorizing and routing incoming support requests or customer inquiries
- Extracting data from invoices, applications, or standardized forms
- Answering internal questions from a company knowledge base or documentation
- Researching companies, contacts, or market data before sales calls

### Use cases to avoid for your first pilot

- Anything customer-facing without human review (too risky for a first test)
- Complex decision-making that requires judgment and context (AI isn't ready for this)
- Tasks that don't have a clear "right answer" (makes measurement impossible)
- Processes that aren't documented yet (if you can't explain the steps to a person, you can't explain them to AI)

## The two-week test framework

We recommend a structured two-week test. Not because two weeks is magic, but because it's long enough to get real data and short enough to avoid runaway costs.

### Week one: setup and learning

**Days 1-2: Define the scope.** Write down exactly what the AI will do. Not "help with customer service" but "read incoming support emails, categorize them as billing/shipping/product/other, and draft a first response for shipping questions." Be specific. The narrower the scope, the better your pilot will go.

**Days 3-4: Pick the tool.** For most first pilots, you don't need custom development. Start with an off-the-shelf tool. ChatGPT Team, Claude Projects, or a specialized tool for your use case (Intercom Fin for support, Otter for meeting notes, etc.). Set it up with your data, your instructions, and your company context.

**Day 5: Test internally.** Run the AI on 10-20 real examples from the past. Compare its output to what your team actually did. Where does it get it right? Where does it go wrong? Adjust the instructions based on what you find.

### Week two: real-world testing

**Days 6-10: Run it live alongside your team.** The AI handles the task in parallel with your existing process. Your team still does the work the normal way, but the AI also produces its version. Compare the two.

This parallel approach matters. It lets you evaluate quality without any risk. If the AI output is worse, nothing bad happens because the human still did the work. If the AI output is as good or better, you have evidence.

**Track these metrics daily:**
- Time: How long does the AI take vs. the human?
- Quality: How often does the AI get it right? How often does it need correction?
- Effort: How much time does the human spend reviewing and correcting the AI output?

### End of week two: the decision

By day 10, you should have enough data to answer one question: **does the AI save more time than it costs to manage?**

Calculate the total time your team spent on the task the old way. Calculate the time the AI took plus the time someone spent reviewing, correcting, and managing it. Compare the two.

If the AI saves meaningful time (we usually look for at least 30% improvement), it's worth expanding. If the savings are marginal, either refine the approach or try a different use case. If it's actually slower or produces too many errors, that's valuable information too. You've spent two weeks and a small amount of money to learn that this particular application isn't ready.

## Budget expectations

People always ask us what this costs. Here's an honest breakdown.

Tool costs for a two-week pilot run $50-300. Most AI platforms have team plans around $20-30 per user per month, and you only need a few users. Some specialized tools have free trials that cover the entire pilot period.

The real cost is staff time. Expect 10-15 hours of someone's time over the two weeks for setup, testing, monitoring, and evaluation. For a manager or operations lead, that's $500-1,000 in salary cost. Most people forget to budget for this, and it's the biggest line item.

So the total realistic cost for a first pilot is $100-1,500 depending on the tool and your team's hourly rates. That's it. If someone tells you a pilot project requires $20,000 and three months, they're selling you something bigger than a pilot.

What a pilot should NOT cost you: custom development, platform implementation fees, consulting retainers, or long-term contracts. Save all of that for after you have results that justify the investment.

## The part that's harder than it sounds

We'll be honest: the technical part of running a pilot is the easy part. The hard part is organizational.

**Getting buy-in from the team.** The person whose job the AI will "help with" might feel threatened, skeptical, or just annoyed at having to learn something new while still doing their regular work. Talk to them before the pilot starts. Explain that you're testing the tool, not replacing them. Make them part of the evaluation process, not the subject of it.

**Resisting scope creep.** Once people see the AI working, you'll hear "Can it also do X? What about Y?" The answer is: not yet. Finish the pilot. Measure the results. Then decide what to try next. Expanding scope mid-pilot is the fastest way to turn a focused test into an expensive mess.

**Being honest about the results.** There's a psychological pull toward making the pilot "succeed" because you invested time in it. Resist that. If the numbers don't work, the numbers don't work. A failed pilot that saves you from a bad $50,000 investment is worth every penny you spent on it.

## Common mistakes we see

The biggest one: **picking a use case to impress the board instead of to learn.** Your first pilot should optimize for learning, not for a keynote-worthy outcome. A boring pilot with clear results beats an ambitious one that produces ambiguous data every single time.

People also forget to measure the baseline. If you don't know how long the task takes today, you can't measure improvement. Spend those first two days timing and documenting the current process before you introduce anything new.

Then there's skipping the human review step. Every AI output in a pilot should be checked by a person. No exceptions. This isn't about distrust. It's about data collection. The corrections your team makes are what tell you exactly where the AI needs work.

And finally: don't try to automate a broken process. If the current workflow is inconsistent, poorly documented, or different every time someone does it, AI will make it worse, not better. Fix the process first. The automation comes after.

## After the pilot: what comes next

If the pilot worked, you have a decision to make. Do you expand this specific use case to more of the team? Do you try AI on a different workflow? Both?

Our recommendation: expand the successful pilot first. Roll it out to the full team on that one workflow. Get comfortable with the tool. Build confidence. Let the team get good at working with AI on one thing before you add another.

Then pick the next use case and run another pilot. Same framework. Same two weeks. Same honest measurement.

**The businesses that succeed with AI treat it as a series of small, measured bets.** Not one big gamble. Each pilot teaches you something about what works for your team, your data, your specific corner of the world. After three or four pilots, you'll have a clearer picture of where AI fits in your business than any strategy deck could give you, and you'll have gotten there for a fraction of the cost.

One workflow. Two weeks. Honest numbers. Everything else follows from that.
