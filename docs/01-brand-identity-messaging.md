# number6.ai — Brand Identity & Messaging

## Brand Foundation

### The Name

**number6.ai** — A subtle nod to Number Six (Caprica Six) from Battlestar Galactica: an AI character who was indistinguishable from human, who bridged two worlds, and who ultimately helped both sides understand each other. That's our job — bridging the gap between AI and the people who use it.

The name works on multiple levels:

- **Cultural resonance:** Instantly recognizable to the sci-fi-literate tech community, but doesn't alienate anyone unfamiliar with the reference. It's just a clean, memorable name.
- **The "6" as brand mark:** A strong, distinctive visual element that anchors the entire identity system.
- **Conversational hook:** "Why number 6?" is a natural question that opens a story — and stories sell.
- **Domain clarity:** number6.ai is clean, short, and immediately signals the AI space.

The BSG reference stays subtle. We never plaster Cylon imagery on the site. The name carries the reference; everything else is clean and modern.

## Positioning Statement

**For small and mid-sized businesses that know AI matters but don't know where to start,** number6.ai is the AI consulting partner that turns confusion into clarity and tools into results — without the hype, the jargon, or the six-figure invoices.

Unlike enterprise consultancies that sell strategy decks you'll never implement, or freelancers who build a chatbot and disappear, number6.ai walks with you from first understanding through full adoption — teaching your team to fish, not just handing them a fish.

### One-liner (elevator pitch)

> We help businesses understand, adopt, and build with AI — practically, honestly, and without the buzzwords.

## Tagline Options

**Primary recommendation:**

> **AI that works. For people who work.**

**Alternates (ranked):**

1. **Practical AI. Real results.** — Direct, no-nonsense. Lands the anti-hype message immediately.
2. **Your AI starts here.** — Inviting, low-barrier. Positions number6 as the beginning of a journey.
3. **AI consulting for the rest of us.** — Deliberately populist. Positions against enterprise gatekeeping.
4. **Making AI make sense.** — Warm, approachable. Emphasizes the demystification angle.
5. **Less hype. More done.** — Punchy, confident. Strong for social media and headers.

## Brand Voice & Tone

### Voice Attributes

| Attribute | What it means | What it doesn't mean |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Plain-spoken** | We explain things clearly, in human language. No acronym soup. | Dumbed down or condescending. We respect intelligence. |
| **Warm** | Friendly, approachable, occasionally witty. Like a smart colleague. | Bubbly, over-caffeinated, or "startup bro." |
| **Honest** | We'll tell you when AI isn't the answer. We price transparently. | Blunt to the point of rudeness, or contrarian for its own sake. |
| **Confident** | We know our stuff and it shows. We make clear recommendations. | Arrogant, dismissive, or "trust us, we're experts." |
| **Practical** | Every sentence should connect to something a business can do. | Academic, theoretical, or impressive-sounding but empty. |

### Tone Spectrum

The tone shifts by context but stays within these guardrails:

- **Website homepage:** Warm, confident, slightly playful. Like meeting someone impressive at a dinner party.
- **Service descriptions:** Clear, specific, outcome-focused. Like a trusted advisor laying out options.
- **Blog/thought leadership:** Knowledgeable, opinionated, accessible. Like a great conference talk.
- **Proposals/sales:** Professional, direct, evidence-driven. Respectful of the buyer's time.
- **Training/workshops:** Encouraging, patient, energizing. Like the best teacher you ever had.

### Voice Do's and Don'ts

**Do say:**
- "Here's what this means for your Tuesday morning."
- "You don't need to understand transformer architecture. You need to understand what it can do for your sales pipeline."
- "We'll be honest — for this use case, a spreadsheet formula might be all you need."
- "AI isn't magic. It's a tool. Let's figure out if it's the right tool for your problem."

**Don't say:**
- "Leverage cutting-edge AI to drive transformational outcomes across your enterprise."
- "Our proprietary AI framework unlocks unprecedented value."
- "In this rapidly evolving landscape..."
- "We harness the power of artificial intelligence."
- Anything with "synergy," "paradigm shift," "disrupt," or "revolutionize."

## Key Messages

### Primary Message
AI is already changing how businesses work. The question isn't whether to use it — it's how to use it well. number6.ai helps you answer that question with honesty, expertise, and a plan that actually gets implemented.

### Supporting Messages

**Message 1: The Honesty Angle**
Most AI consultants want to sell you AI. We'd rather sell you the right solution — even if that means telling you a spreadsheet will do the job. When AI *is* the answer, we'll make sure it works, your team understands it, and it pays for itself.

**Message 2: The Accessibility Angle**
You don't need a PhD, a massive budget, or a dedicated tech team to benefit from AI. You need a clear understanding of what's possible, a practical plan, and someone to walk you through it. That's us.

**Message 3: The Results Angle**
We don't deliver 90-page strategy decks that gather dust. We deliver working AI tools your team actually uses, training that actually sticks, and measurable results you can see within 90 days.

**Message 4: The Human Angle**
AI should make your team's work better, not make your team obsolete. We design every solution around the people who'll use it — because the best AI in the world is useless if nobody trusts it.

**Message 5: The Partnership Angle**
We're a small, senior team on two continents. When you work with us, you get us — not a junior analyst reading from a script. We're invested in your success because our reputation depends on it.

**number6.ai occupies the top-right quadrant:** high expertise delivered with high accessibility. This is the "missing middle" that the market research identified — senior-level AI consulting that's approachable, transparently priced, and designed for businesses that aren't Fortune 500.

## Brand Pillars

### 1. Radical Transparency
We publish our prices. We explain our process. We tell you when AI isn't the answer. In a market where 89% of competitors hide their rates, transparency is our superpower.

### 2. Practical Over Impressive
Every recommendation connects to a real business outcome. We measure success in hours saved, revenue gained, and problems solved — not in how sophisticated the technology sounds.

### 3. Teach, Don't Create Dependency
We train your team alongside every engagement. The goal is for you to need us less over time, not more. That's how you know the AI adoption actually worked.

### 4. Senior From Day One
With a two-person team, there's no bait-and-switch. You work with the same experienced consultants from first call to final delivery. No handoffs to junior staff.

### 5. Global Reach, Human Scale
Houston and Manchester. Two time zones. One small team that knows your name, your business, and your goals. Big enough to deliver, small enough to care.

## Naming Conventions

### Service Naming Philosophy
Service names should be clear and descriptive, not branded with proprietary jargon. Exception: one proprietary framework (see below) that serves as a lead-generation and credibility tool.

### The number6 AI Readiness Index™
A proprietary assessment framework that becomes the cornerstone entry point. Every successful boutique competitor has one. Ours evaluates six dimensions (playing on the brand name):

1. **Strategy** — Is there a clear vision for AI in your business?
2. **Data** — Is your data organized, accessible, and clean enough to power AI?
3. **People** — Does your team have the skills and willingness to work with AI?
4. **Process** — Which workflows have the highest automation/augmentation potential?
5. **Technology** — Is your current tech stack AI-ready?
6. **Governance** — Do you have policies for responsible AI use?

Six dimensions. number6. The brand reference is elegant without being forced.

## Content & Thought Leadership Strategy

### Core Content Themes
1. **"AI for Actual Humans"** — Demystifying AI concepts without dumbing them down
2. **"The Honest Take"** — Candid assessments of AI tools, trends, and hype
3. **"90-Day Wins"** — Case studies showing fast, measurable ROI from AI adoption
4. **"Behind the Agent"** — Technical deep-dives on agentic AI, RAG, and custom AI development for the builder audience

### Content Formats
- Weekly LinkedIn posts (both partners, coordinated)
- Bi-weekly blog articles on number6.ai
- Monthly "AI Reality Check" newsletter

### Social Media Tone
LinkedIn-primary. Informed, opinionated, practical. Share real project learnings (anonymized). Engage with AI hype critically. Celebrate client wins. Avoid: thought-leader clichés, "I'm humbled to announce," listicle posts.
