## 1. What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files placed on your device (computer, tablet, or phone) when you visit a website. They help websites function properly, remember your preferences, and understand how visitors use the site.

Similar technologies include pixels, web beacons, local storage, and session storage. In this policy, "cookies" refers to all of these technologies collectively.

## 2. How We Use Cookies

We use cookies for the following purposes:

### 2.1 Strictly Necessary Cookies

These cookies are essential for the Site to function. They cannot be disabled.

| Cookie | Purpose | Duration |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Cookie consent preference | Remembers your cookie consent choice so we don't ask you repeatedly | 1 year |
| Security cookies | Protect against cross-site request forgery and other threats | Session |

### 2.2 Analytics Cookies

These cookies help us understand how visitors interact with the Site — which pages are popular, how people navigate, and where they drop off. This data is aggregated and anonymized; we do not use analytics cookies to identify individual visitors.

| Cookie | Provider | Purpose | Duration |
|--------|----------|---------|----------|
| Analytics tracking | Google Analytics / Plausible | Page views, session duration, traffic sources, device info | Up to 26 months |

**Note:** We are committed to privacy-respecting analytics. If we use Google Analytics, we enable IP anonymization and disable data sharing with Google for advertising purposes. We may use or switch to privacy-first alternatives like Plausible Analytics, which does not use cookies at all.

### 2.3 Functional Cookies

These cookies enable enhanced functionality and personalization.

| Cookie | Purpose | Duration |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Scheduling widget | Powers the embedded booking/scheduling tool (e.g., Calendly) for discovery calls | Session to 1 year |
| Form pre-fill | Remembers form field entries so you don't have to re-type if you navigate away | Session |

### 2.4 Marketing Cookies

We currently use **minimal or no marketing cookies**. If this changes — for example, if we run advertising campaigns — we will update this policy and request your consent before placing marketing cookies.

If enabled in the future, marketing cookies may be used for:

- Measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.
- Retargeting visitors with relevant content on other platforms.
- Understanding which channels drive the most valuable traffic.

We will never use marketing cookies without your explicit opt-in consent.

## 3. Third-Party Cookies

Some cookies on the Site are placed by third-party services we use. These third parties have their own privacy and cookie policies:

| Third Party | Purpose | Their Privacy Policy |
|-------------|---------|---------------------|
| Google Analytics | Website analytics | [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) |
| Calendly | Meeting scheduling | [Calendly Privacy Policy](https://calendly.com/privacy) |
| Stripe | Payment processing (if applicable) | [Stripe Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/privacy) |

We select third-party providers carefully and require them to handle data responsibly. However, we do not control their cookies — please review their policies for details.
