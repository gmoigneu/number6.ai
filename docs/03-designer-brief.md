# number6.ai — Homepage Design Brief

## Project Overview

**Client:** number6.ai
**Project:** Presentation website — homepage design (with system scalable to inner pages)
**Brand personality:** Reassuring but fun. Innovative but grounded. Expert but approachable.
**One sentence:** Design a site that feels like the smart, warm friend you'd trust to help you understand AI — not a cold tech company, not a corporate consultancy.

---

## Context & Positioning

number6.ai is a two-person AI consulting boutique based in Houston, TX and Manchester, UK. They help SMBs and mid-sized companies understand, adopt, and build with AI. The name is a subtle nod to a Battlestar Galactica character (Number Six / Caprica Six) — an AI who bridged the gap between machines and humans. The reference should be felt, never stated overtly in the design.

**Key competitor landscape insight:** The AI consulting space is visually monotonous — dominated by dark mode, blue/purple gradients, hexagonal patterns, and generic "neural network" illustrations. The most praised AI brand identity in 2025 (Anthropic) broke this mold with warm earth tones and hand-drawn illustrations. number6.ai should follow this counter-positioning: warm, human, distinctive.

**The brief in a nutshell:** Make it look like nothing else in the AI space. Make people feel safe, curious, and excited — in that order.

## Brand Personality Matrix

| Axis | We are | We are NOT |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Temperature** | Warm, inviting | Cold, clinical, dark-mode-by-default |
| **Confidence** | Quietly confident, expert | Arrogant, "we're the best" |
| **Tone** | Conversational, occasionally witty | Corporate, stiff, buzzwordy |
| **Innovation** | Modern, forward-thinking | Gimmicky, "look how techy we are" |
| **Trust** | Transparent, evidence-based | Slick, over-promising |
| **Complexity** | Simple to navigate, clear | Overwhelming, feature-heavy |

**Reference brands for tone (not for copying, but for calibration):**
- **Anthropic (claude.ai)** — Warm, earthy, human-first. The gold standard for making AI feel approachable.
- **Linear.app** — Clean, confident, beautifully minimal. Proves you can be innovative without visual noise.
- **Basecamp** — Warm, opinionated, practical. Great example of a small team with big personality.
- **Stripe** — Professional, precise, generous whitespace. Trust through clarity.

## Color Direction

### Philosophy
Break from the AI industry's blue-gradient-hexagon convention. Lead with warmth. Use color to feel human, not robotic.

### Palette Direction (designer to refine)

**Primary — Warm & Distinctive:**
A warm amber, deep gold, terracotta, or rich teal as the primary brand color. Something unexpected in the AI space that immediately signals "this is different." This should feel confident but not loud.

**Dark — Rich, Not Cold:**
Charcoal, warm dark grey, or deep navy — never pure black. Used for text and dark sections. Should feel sophisticated, not moody.

**Light — Warm White:**
Off-white, cream, or warm grey for backgrounds. Avoid stark white. The light palette should feel like quality paper, not a hospital.

**Accent — Vibrant CTA Color:**
Coral, electric amber, warm red, or vibrant teal for buttons, links, and interactive elements. Should pop against both light and dark backgrounds.

**Subtle BSG Nod (tertiary/utility):**
Consider incorporating muted olive, warm grey, or brass tones as tertiary colors — evoking the grounded, utilitarian aesthetic of the Battlestar Galactica universe without being literal. These could appear in borders, dividers, code blocks, or secondary UI elements.

### What to Avoid
- Blue gradients (too generic AI)
- Purple/violet (too "metaverse")
- Neon accents on dark backgrounds (too developer-tool)
- Pure black backgrounds as default (too cold)
- Rainbow gradients (too unfocused)

## Typography Direction

### Philosophy
Serif + sans-serif pairing for warmth and personality. The 2025 trend of moving away from all-sans-serif is a strong fit for number6's human-first positioning.

### Recommended Approach

**Display / Headlines:** A humanist sans-serif with character — Söhne, Satoshi, General Sans, Plus Jakarta Sans, or similar. Bold weight. Should feel modern and confident.

**Body Text:** A warm serif OR a clean sans-serif for readability. If serif: Source Serif, Tiempos Text, Fraunces, or Literata. If sans: Inter, DM Sans, or the same family as display. The choice depends on how much warmth vs. crispness the designer wants to achieve.

**Utility / Monospace:** JetBrains Mono, IBM Plex Mono, or Fira Code for code snippets, technical details, and pricing figures. Adds a subtle "we know code" credibility signal.

### Type Hierarchy
- Display headings: Large, bold, confident. Generous line-height.
- Section headings: Clear hierarchy, not competing with display.
- Body: 18-20px minimum, comfortable reading length (60-75 characters per line).
- CTAs: Bold, clear, sized for thumb taps on mobile.

## Visual & Illustration Style

### The "6" as Brand Mark
The numeral "6" is the core visual element of the brand. It should be treated as a distinctive mark that can stand alone as a favicon, social avatar, and pattern element. Explore:
- A custom-drawn "6" with character (not a generic typeface)
- The "6" used as a recurring motif in layouts, section dividers, or background patterns
- Subtle animation of the "6" on the homepage (e.g., a gentle rotation, a drawn-in-line effect)

### Illustration Style
**Do:** Custom illustration with organic, hand-drawn quality. Think Anthropic's watercolor approach or editorial illustration — warm, human, slightly imperfect. Illustrations should depict *concepts* (collaboration, understanding, building) not *technology* (neural networks, circuits, robots).

**Don't:** AI-generated illustration (ironic for an AI company, and looks cheap). Stock photography of people pointing at screens. Generic tech iconography (hexagons, connected nodes, brain imagery). 3D renders of abstract shapes.

**Illustration subjects that work:**
- People working together, having "aha" moments
- Abstract organic shapes that suggest connection and growth
- Metaphorical imagery: bridges, paths, maps, tools
- Playful nods to the number 6 (six dots, six steps, six elements)

### Photography
If real photography is used (e.g., for team or case studies), it should be:
- Warm-toned, naturally lit
- Candid/editorial style, not posed corporate
- Focused on people and environments, not screens
- Consistent filter/treatment across all images

### Iconography
Custom icon set, line-based, with consistent stroke weight. Rounded, friendly geometry — not sharp or angular. Should feel hand-drawn or at minimum hand-refined, not pulled from a generic icon library.

## Homepage Layout & Structure

### General Principles
- **Light mode primary.** Dark mode toggle optional but not required.
- **Generous whitespace.** Let the content breathe. The site should feel spacious, not packed.
- **Single-column dominant** with occasional two-column moments. Avoid three-column layouts on desktop — they feel "enterprise."
- **Scroll-based storytelling.** The homepage is a narrative: Problem → Solution → How → Proof → Action.
- **Mobile-first design.** Over 60% of SMB decision-makers first encounter sites on mobile.

### Section-by-Section Layout Notes

#### 1. Hero (Full viewport)
- Bold headline, left-aligned or centered
- Subheadline underneath
- Two CTAs: primary (Book a call) + secondary (scroll down / see packages)
- Background: subtle texture, warm color wash, or abstract illustration — not a stock photo
- Consider a small animated element (the "6" mark, a subtle particle effect, or a drawing-in animation) to add life without overwhelming
- **No autoplaying video.** No carousel.

#### 2. Trust Bar
- Slim horizontal band below the hero
- Client logos (greyscale) OR stat counters pre-launch
- Subtle background differentiation (slight color shift or border)

#### 3. Problem Statement
- Text-focused section with generous padding
- Maybe a single supporting illustration
- Short paragraphs, no more than 3-4 sentences visible before scroll

#### 4. Services Overview (4 cards)
- Grid of four cards: Learn, Plan, Build, Grow
- Each card: icon + title + 2-line description + arrow/link
- Cards should feel clickable and interactive (hover state, subtle lift)
- Consider a warm colored background for this section to break the flow

#### 5. How We Work (3 steps)
- Horizontal timeline/process on desktop, vertical on mobile
- Numbered steps with short titles and descriptions
- Visual connectors between steps (line, dots, or path)
- Clean, simple, no over-design here

#### 6. Differentiators
- Alternating left/right blocks or a clean list with icons
- Each differentiator: bold headline + 2-sentence explanation
- This is where personality shines — let the copy breathe

#### 7. Who It's For
- Four industry/segment mini-cards with icons
- Short text block above setting context
- Optional: a gentle "Don't see your industry?" micro-CTA

#### 8. Social Proof
- Quote block(s) with attribution
- Stat cards showing impact metrics
- If pre-launch: styled as a branded "what we typically see" data block

#### 9. The Name (Story Moment)
- Small, warm section — could be a callout box or a distinct styled block
- Optional section — can be hidden pre-launch if client prefers
- Conversational, not prominent. A reward for people who scroll this far.

#### 10. Final CTA
- Full-width section with strong visual treatment (warm color block)
- Large headline + subheadline + single prominent CTA button
- This is the conversion moment — make it inviting, not aggressive

#### 11. Footer
- Clean, minimal
- Company name + locations + email + social links
- Legal links
- Optional: newsletter signup inline

## Interactive & Animation Guidelines

### Philosophy
Purposeful, not performative. Every animation should serve comprehension or delight — never just decoration.

### Recommended
- Gentle fade-in-up on scroll for content sections (staggered, not all at once)
- Subtle hover states on cards and buttons (lift, color shift, or underline expand)
- The "6" brand mark as a subtly animated hero element
- Smooth scroll between sections when triggered by navigation
- Number counters that animate when stat blocks enter viewport

### Avoid
- Parallax scrolling (feels dated)
- Heavy particle effects or 3D renders (too gimmicky for a consulting site)
- Auto-playing video backgrounds
- Scroll-jacking (always let users scroll naturally)
- Any animation that delays content access or hurts performance

## Responsive Considerations

- **Desktop (1200px+):** Full layout as described. Two-column moments where noted.
- **Tablet (768-1199px):** Service cards stack to 2x2. Process steps may go vertical. Hero text scales down.
- **Mobile (< 768px):** Everything stacks single-column. CTAs become full-width. Font sizes adjust (minimum 16px body). Hero headline should still feel impactful at mobile widths.

**Critical mobile requirements:**
- CTA buttons must be thumb-friendly (minimum 48px height)
- Phone number and email should be tap-to-call / tap-to-email
- Navigation: hamburger menu or minimal top nav
- Load time under 3 seconds on 4G

---

## Technical Requirements

- **Framework:** Static site or JAMstack (Next.js, Astro, or similar) — no heavy CMS needed for a site this size
- **Hosting:** Prefer edge-deployed (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages) for global speed
- **Performance:** 90+ Lighthouse score on all metrics. Core Web Vitals compliant.
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA minimum. Proper heading hierarchy, alt text, keyboard navigation, sufficient contrast ratios.
- **SEO:** Semantic HTML, proper meta tags, Open Graph tags, structured data (LocalBusiness schema for both locations)
- **Analytics:** Privacy-respecting analytics (Plausible, Fathom, or similar) — no Google Analytics unless explicitly requested
- **Forms:** Booking integration (Calendly or Cal.com embed) for discovery calls. Contact form as backup.

## Final Note to the Designer

The AI consulting space is drowning in sameness — dark backgrounds, blue gradients, hexagonal logos, neural network illustrations. Every competitor looks like they were designed by the same AI. The biggest favor you can do for number6.ai is to make it look like *nothing else in this space*. 

The brand should feel like walking into a beautifully designed independent bookshop after visiting a row of identical chain stores. Warm. Distinctive. Clearly expert. Unmistakably human.

Make the "6" iconic. Make the warmth real. Make people *want* to click "Book a call."
