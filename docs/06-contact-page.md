## Page Hero

### Headline
**Let's talk. No pitch, no pressure — just a conversation.**

### Subheadline
Whether you're exploring AI for the first time or ready to build something specific, we'd love to hear what you're working on. Every conversation starts the same way: we listen.

---

## SECTION 1: Contact Options

### Section headline
**Three ways to get started.**

[Three cards or blocks — each with an icon, title, description, and action. Equal visual weight. The discovery call should feel like the primary path.]

---

### Option 1: Book a Discovery Call
**The best way to start.**

A free 30-minute video call with one of us. We'll learn about your business, answer your questions, and give you an honest take on where AI might help. No slides. No sales script. Just a real conversation.

**CTA Button:** Book your free call →

[Embed: Calendly or Cal.com scheduling widget. Should show available times across both US Central and UK time zones.]

---

### Option 2: Send Us a Message
**Prefer to write? We're great readers.**

Drop us a message with whatever's on your mind. A question, a project idea, a "we have no idea where to start" — all welcome. We respond within one business day.

[Contact form — see form fields below]

---

### Option 3: Just Say Hello
**Sometimes a quick email is all you need.**

hello@number6.ai

## SECTION 3: What to Expect

### Section headline
**Here's what happens next.**

[Three-step horizontal process — mirrors the "How We Work" section from the homepage but specific to the first contact experience]

---

**Step 1: We respond (fast).**
You'll hear back from us within one business day — usually sooner. Not from an assistant or an autoresponder. From one of us.

---

**Step 2: We have a real conversation.**
On your discovery call, we'll ask about your business, your team, and what you're hoping AI can do. We'll share our honest take — including whether we think AI is even the right answer.

---

**Step 3: We give you a clear next step.**
Whether it's a proposal, a recommendation, or a "here's what you should try on your own first" — you'll leave the conversation knowing exactly where you stand. No follow-up pressure.

---

## SECTION 4: FAQ / Common Questions

### Section headline
**Questions people usually ask before getting in touch.**

[Accordion or clean list format. Keep answers short — 2-3 sentences each.]

---

**Is the discovery call really free?**
Yes. 30 minutes, no strings attached. We don't do bait-and-switch. If we can't help you, we'll tell you that too.

---

**I'm not sure if my business is ready for AI. Should I still reach out?**
Absolutely. That's exactly what the discovery call is for. Most of our clients start with "I don't know where to begin" — and that's a perfectly good place to start.

---

**Do you work with companies outside the US and UK?**
Yes. Most of our work is delivered virtually, so location doesn't matter. We've worked with teams across North America, Europe, and beyond.

---

**How quickly can you start?**
For workshops and assessments, usually within 2-3 weeks. For larger projects, we'll scope and schedule during the discovery call. We're a small team, so we take on a limited number of clients at a time — which means you get our full attention.

---

**What if I just have a quick question?**
Email us at hello@number6.ai. Not everything needs to be a formal engagement. Sometimes a quick answer is all you need, and we're happy to help.

---

## SECTION 5: Location & Timezone Info

### Section headline
**We're where you are.**

[Minimal — two-column or side-by-side layout]

**Houston, Texas**
Central Time (CT)
Available for in-person meetings in the Houston metro area.

**Manchester, United Kingdom**
GMT / BST
Available for in-person meetings in the Greater Manchester area.

**Virtual delivery worldwide.** Most of our work happens over video call — which means timezone, not geography, is what matters. Between Houston and Manchester, we cover business hours from UTC-6 to UTC+1.

---

## CTA Section

### Headline
**Still thinking about it? That's fine.**

### Body
Bookmark this page. Follow us on LinkedIn. Read our blog. When you're ready, we'll be here. And when you do reach out — we promise it'll be the most refreshingly un-salesy conversation you've had with a consulting firm.

### CTA Button

## Writing & Design Notes

1. **Calendly/Cal.com embed:** The scheduling widget should be prominent — ideally visible without scrolling on desktop. Consider making it the centerpiece of the page rather than burying it below a form.

2. **Form simplicity:** The form should feel lightweight, not like a procurement questionnaire. Most fields are optional on purpose. Don't make people work to contact us.

3. **Timezone display:** If technically feasible, consider showing both partners' current local time on the page (live clock). It reinforces the global presence and helps visitors know if someone is "in office" right now.

4. **Mobile:** The booking widget and email address should be the stars on mobile. The full form can be secondary. Tap-to-email and tap-to-call (if we add a phone number later) are essential.

5. **No CAPTCHA if possible:** Use honeypot spam prevention instead. CAPTCHAs are hostile and undermine the "we're approachable" message.

6. **Thank-you state:** After form submission, don't redirect to a separate page. Show the confirmation inline with a smooth transition. Keep the booking widget visible as a secondary action.
