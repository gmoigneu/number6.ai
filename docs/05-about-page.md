## Our Story

### Section headline
**We started number6 because we were tired of the AI hype gap.**

### Body copy

On one side: breathless headlines about AI changing everything. On the other: real businesses — the kind that actually make the economy run — struggling to figure out what any of it means for them.

We've spent our careers building technology, deploying it in the real world, and teaching people how to use it. Between us, we've worked across web development, cloud infrastructure, developer advocacy, and AI engineering — in companies of every size, on both sides of the Atlantic.

What we kept seeing was the same pattern: organizations that *wanted* to use AI but didn't know where to start. Teams that had tried tools but couldn't make them stick. Leaders who sensed the opportunity but couldn't separate the signal from the noise.

So we built number6.ai to be the AI partner we wished existed — one that's honest about what AI can and can't do, transparent about what it costs, and committed to making sure every solution actually gets used after we leave the room.

We're not a big consultancy. We're not going to hand you a strategy deck and wave goodbye. We're two experienced people who sit down with your team, understand your work, and help you do it better with AI. Then we teach you how to keep going without us.

That's it. No mystique. No "proprietary AI platform." Just expertise, honesty, and a genuine investment in your success.

## What We Believe

### Section headline
**Our principles. Non-negotiable.**

[Can be displayed as a clean list with icons, or as alternating blocks]

---

**Honesty over sales.**
If AI isn't the right solution for your problem, we'll tell you. We'd rather lose a deal than sell you something that doesn't work. Counterintuitively, this is also why clients trust us enough to come back for more.

---

**Results over impressions.**
We don't measure success by how sophisticated the technology is. We measure it by hours saved, revenue gained, and teams that actually use what we built. If it doesn't move the needle, it doesn't matter.

---

**Teaching over dependency.**
Every engagement includes training. Every project leaves your team more capable than before. Our goal is for you to need us less over time — not more. We consider it a success when you outgrow us.

---

**Transparency over mystery.**
Our prices are published. Our process is documented. Our recommendations are explained in plain language. We believe you deserve to understand what you're buying and why.

---

**People over technology.**
AI is a tool. Your people are the strategy. We design every solution around the humans who'll use it — their workflows, their comfort level, their daily reality. The best AI in the world is worthless if the team doesn't trust it.

---

## Our Team

### Section headline
**Small team. Big experience. Direct access.**

### Section intro
When you work with number6, you work with us directly. No account managers. No junior associates. No outsourced developers. The people on this page are the people in your meetings, building your solutions, and training your team.

### Team Member 1

**[Photo — warm, candid, editorial style]**

**Partner — Houston, TX**

With deep roots in developer advocacy, cloud platforms, and web engineering, our Houston partner brings years of experience translating complex technology into practical business value. A background spanning infrastructure optimization, AI research, and technical leadership means they've seen what works at scale — and what doesn't.

They've spoken at international conferences, worked as a Field CTO, and built solutions across industries from arena operations to professional services. When they're not helping clients adopt AI, you'll find them exploring the latest research papers or teaching their kids that math can actually be fun.

**Specialties:** AI strategy, agentic AI development, performance engineering, developer experience, technical training.

**Specialties:** [To be defined based on partner's background]

### Why Two People?

You might wonder: can two people really deliver all this? Here's our honest answer.

For workshops, training, strategy, and advisory — two senior people are all you need, and arguably better than a larger team. You get undivided attention, consistent quality, and zero handoffs between "the person who sold it" and "the person who does it."

For complex builds (custom agents, RAG systems), we work with a curated network of trusted specialists we've vetted through years of professional collaboration. They work under our direct supervision, to our standards. You always have one of us as your single point of contact — we never disappear behind a team.

The boutique model isn't a limitation. It's a deliberate choice. It means we take on fewer clients, deliver higher quality, and actually care about every engagement because our reputation is on the line with every single one.

## Why "number 6"?

### Section headline
**The name. The story. The metaphor.**

If you're a fan of Battlestar Galactica, you already know. Number Six — also known as Caprica Six — was an AI character who was indistinguishable from human. But more than that: she was a bridge between two worlds, helping humans and machines understand each other.

That's what we do.

We bridge the gap between AI and the people who work with it. We translate between what the technology can do and what your business needs it to do. We make the unfamiliar feel familiar.

And yes — our AI Readiness Index™ just happens to have six dimensions. We noticed that too.

(If you've never seen the show, honestly, it's worth watching. But you don't need to be a sci-fi fan to work with us. Promise.)

## Where We Work

### Section headline
**Houston. Manchester. Everywhere in between.**

[Simple visual: map or two-city graphic. Not a huge section — just enough to establish presence.]

**Houston, Texas**
Central Time Zone. Serving clients across the Americas.

**Manchester, United Kingdom**
GMT / BST. Serving clients across the UK, Europe, and beyond.

Our transatlantic setup isn't just a flag on a map. It means genuine timezone coverage — your morning is our morning, whether you're in New York or London. Most of our work is delivered virtually, but we're available in person across both regions.

## How We Got Here

### A brief timeline (optional — can be a minimal visual timeline)

**2020-2024** — Both partners build deep AI expertise through hands-on work: production deployments, research, developer advocacy, and hundreds of hours of real-world AI training and consulting.

**2025** — The AI adoption gap becomes impossible to ignore. Businesses need help, but the market offers either overpriced enterprise consultancies or under-qualified "AI gurus." We decide to fix that.

**2026** — number6.ai launches. Two people, two continents, one mission: practical AI consulting that actually works.
