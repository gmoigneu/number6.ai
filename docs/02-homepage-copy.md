## SECTION 2: Trust Bar

[Logos of client companies or, if pre-launch, replace with a stats bar]

### Pre-launch version (stats bar):

**60%** of business leaders say they have an AI skills gap | **77%** of SMBs want AI help with marketing & operations | **91%** of AI-adopting SMBs say the tools are vital to staying competitive

### Post-launch version:
[Client logos] + "Trusted by teams from [City] to [City]"

---

## SECTION 3: The Problem

### Section headline
**AI is everywhere. Clarity isn't.**

### Body copy
You've seen the headlines. You've heard the promises. Maybe you've even tried a few AI tools. But somewhere between the hype and the how-to, things got confusing.

You're not alone. Most businesses know AI matters — they just don't know where to start, what to trust, or how to make it work for *their* team, *their* workflows, *their* budget.

That's where we come in.

---

## SECTION 4: What We Do (Services Overview)

### Section headline
**From "what is this?" to "how did we live without it?"**

### Section subheadline
Whether you're just getting started or ready to build something custom, we meet you where you are.

[Four service cards — each with an icon, title, short description, and link]

---

### Card 1: Learn
**AI Foundations & Training**

Workshops, coaching, and team training that turn AI confusion into AI confidence. For leaders who want to understand. For teams who want to do.

---

### Card 2: Plan
**AI Strategy & Readiness**

Our number6 AI Readiness Index™ evaluates your business across six dimensions and gives you a prioritized roadmap — not a 90-page report that gathers dust.

---

### Card 3: Build

[Learn more →]

---

## SECTION 5: How We Work

### Section headline
**No mystery. No jargon. Here's how it works.**

[Three-step horizontal process — clean, visual, numbered]

---

**Step 1: We listen**
Every engagement starts with understanding your business, your team, and your goals. Not with a sales pitch. Not with a pre-built solution looking for a problem.

---

**Step 2: We plan (honestly)**
We identify where AI will genuinely help — and where it won't. You get a clear, prioritized plan with real costs and real timelines. No surprises.

---

**Step 3: We build and teach**
We don't just deliver and disappear. We build alongside your team, train them as we go, and make sure the solution works long after we've left. The goal is for you to need us less, not more.

---

## SECTION 6: The Differentiator

### Section headline
**Why number6?**

[Two-column layout or alternating left/right blocks with icons or small illustrations]

---

**We publish our prices.**
In a market where almost every AI consultancy hides their rates, we believe you deserve to know what things cost before the first call. Check our packages — they're right there on the site.

---

**We'll tell you when you don't need AI.**
Some problems are better solved with a spreadsheet, a process change, or a good hire. We'll tell you. Honestly. Our job is to find the right solution, not to sell you the fanciest one.

---

**You get us. Not a junior team.**
We're a senior two-person team. When you hire number6, you work directly with the people who've spent years building, deploying, and teaching AI. No bait-and-switch. No handoff.

---

**Two continents. Your timezone.**
Based in Houston, TX and Manchester, UK, we cover the Americas and Europe with overlapping hours and a genuinely global perspective. Morning call in Texas, afternoon call in London — we've got you.

---

**We teach your team to fish.**
Every project includes training. Every engagement ends with your team knowing more than when we started. Because the best AI adoption is the kind that doesn't depend on us being in the room.

---

## SECTION 7: Who It's For

### Section headline
**We work with businesses that want to move, not just talk.**

### Body copy
Our clients are typically companies with 10 to 500 people — large enough to benefit from AI, nimble enough to actually adopt it. We work across industries, but we're especially experienced with:

[Four mini-cards or icon blocks]

- **Professional services** — Law firms, accounting practices, consultancies
- **Marketing & creative agencies** — Content, campaigns, client workflows
- **Operations-heavy businesses** — Logistics, manufacturing, field services
- **Tech-forward SMBs** — SaaS companies, startups, digital businesses

Don't see your industry? That's fine — AI doesn't care about verticals. If your team does repetitive knowledge work, we can probably help.

---

## SECTION 8: Social Proof / Results

### Section headline
**Real work. Real numbers.**

[Case study cards or stat blocks. Pre-launch: use anonymized examples or projected outcomes based on market benchmarks. Post-launch: replace with actual client results.]

---

### Pre-launch version:

> "Most businesses we assess are already sitting on 3-5 high-impact AI opportunities they haven't spotted yet. The average number6 engagement delivers measurable time savings within 90 days."

**Stat block:**

| What we typically see | Impact |
|---|---|
| Hours saved per employee per week on repetitive tasks | 5-10 hrs |
| Time from first call to working AI solution | 30-90 days |
| Client teams trained per engagement | 8-25 people |
| Clients who expand to additional projects | 80%+ |

---

### Post-launch template:

> "[Quote from real client about their experience]"
> — [First name], [Role], [Company type/size]

---

## SECTION 9: The Name (Story Block)

[Optional — a small, warm section that addresses the natural curiosity about the name. Keeps it subtle.]

### Section headline
**So... why "number 6"?**

### Body copy
If you know, you know. If you don't — it's a small tribute to a fictional character who was really, really good at bridging the gap between humans and machines. We liked the metaphor.

Also: our AI Readiness Index™ has six dimensions. Happy coincidence.

---

## SECTION 10: CTA Block

[Full-width colored section with strong CTA]

### Headline
**Ready to figure out what AI can actually do for your business?**

### Subheadline
Book a free 30-minute discovery call. No pitch, no pressure — just an honest conversation about where you are and where AI might take you.

### CTA Button
**Book your free call** →

### Supporting text

## Writing Notes for the Designer/Developer

1. **Tone calibration:** The copy is deliberately warm and conversational. Please don't "formalize" it during implementation. The casual tone is intentional and tested against competitor messaging.

2. **Paragraph length:** Keep paragraphs short on the live site — 2-3 sentences max for readability. The copy above is already broken into short blocks.

3. **Bold/emphasis:** Use bold sparingly in the live version. The bold in this document is for your reference — on the site, let the typography hierarchy do the work.

4. **CTAs:** The two primary CTAs ("Book a free discovery call" and "See our packages") should appear at minimum in the hero, after the services section, and in the final CTA block. Don't be afraid of repetition — people scroll.

5. **Mobile:** Every section headline should work as a standalone statement on mobile. The copy is written with mobile-first line breaks in mind.

6. **Localization note:** Since we serve both US and UK markets, all copy uses US English spelling by default (the majority market). The UK partner's individual content (blog posts, LinkedIn) can use British English.
