## Page Hero

### Headline
**The Honest Take.**

### Subheadline
Practical thinking about AI — what works, what doesn't, and what it actually means for your business. No hype. No "10 ways AI will change everything" listicles. Just useful ideas from people who do this work every day.

## Blog Identity & Content Strategy

### Blog name
**The Honest Take** — number6.ai's blog

### Content pillars
These map directly to the themes defined in the Brand Identity document (doc 01):

1. **"AI for Actual Humans"** — Demystifying AI concepts without dumbing them down. Explainers, guides, and "here's what this really means" pieces.
2. **"The Honest Take"** — Candid assessments of AI tools, trends, and hype. Opinion pieces. Hot takes with substance.
3. **"90-Day Wins"** — Case studies and examples showing fast, measurable ROI from AI adoption. Pre-launch: use hypothetical scenarios grounded in real market data. Post-launch: real client results (anonymized).
4. **"Behind the Agent"** — Technical deep-dives on agentic AI, RAG systems, prompt engineering, and custom AI development. For the builder audience.

### Tone
Knowledgeable, opinionated, accessible. Like a great conference talk turned into writing. See Brand Voice guidelines in doc 01.

## SECTION 1: Featured Post

[Full-width card at the top of the listing. The most recent or editorially chosen post gets this treatment.]

- Large featured image or illustration
- Category tag (e.g., "AI for Actual Humans")
- Post title (headline size)
- Publication date + estimated read time
- 2-3 line excerpt
- Author name + small avatar
- Read more →

---

## SECTION 2: Post Grid / List

### Layout options (designer's choice)

**Option A — Card grid:**
2-column grid on desktop, single column on mobile. Each card:
- Thumbnail image or illustration
- Category tag
- Post title
- Publication date + read time
- 2-line excerpt
- Author name

**Option B — Editorial list:**
Single-column list with larger entries. Each entry:
- Category tag (left-aligned or as a pill/badge)
- Post title (prominent)
- 2-line excerpt
- Publication date + read time + author
- Subtle thumbnail on the right (optional)

**Recommendation:** Option A for visual richness, Option B for a more editorial, content-first feel. Option B aligns better with the brand's "substance over style" positioning.

### Pagination / Load more
- Show 9-12 posts per page initially
- "Load more" button preferred over traditional pagination
- Infinite scroll is acceptable but should show a clear "end of content" state

---

## SECTION 3: Category Filters

[Horizontal filter bar below the hero, above the post grid]

Filters:
- **All** (default)
- **AI for Actual Humans** — Guides & explainers
- **The Honest Take** — Opinions & analysis
- **90-Day Wins** — Case studies & results
- **Behind the Agent** — Technical deep-dives

[Filters should be pill/tag style. Active filter visually highlighted. Filtering should be instant — no page reload. URL should update for shareability (e.g., `/blog?category=honest-take`).]

## Writing & Design Notes

1. **No "Blog" in the nav.** Consider using "The Honest Take" or "Insights" as the navigation label instead of the generic "Blog." It's more distinctive and reinforces the brand.

2. **Read time matters.** Always show estimated read time. Busy decision-makers use this to decide whether to read now or save for later.

3. **Author matters.** Since number6 is a two-person team, author attribution is personal and builds familiarity. Show author name and photo on each card.

4. **Categories as content strategy.** The four content pillars serve different audience personas. "AI for Actual Humans" and "The Honest Take" serve the Curious Owner and Overwhelmed Operator. "Behind the Agent" serves the Ambitious Builder. "90-Day Wins" serves everyone considering a purchase.

5. **RSS feed.** Include an RSS feed. The technical audience expects it, and it's an easy SEO and distribution win.

6. **Social sharing.** Individual articles should have Open Graph tags and be optimized for LinkedIn sharing specifically (primary social channel per brand strategy).

7. **No sidebar on mobile.** If using a sidebar layout for newsletter signup or categories, it collapses cleanly on mobile.
