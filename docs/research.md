# Complete market intelligence for number6.ai

**The AI consulting market for SMBs is booming — projected to grow from $11 billion in 2025 to $91 billion by 2035 — and boutique firms are uniquely positioned to win.** The competitive landscape reveals a clear gap: most AI consultancies either cater to enterprises with six-figure engagements or offer shallow, commoditized chatbot setups. A two-person firm like number6.ai can own the middle ground with transparent pricing, genuine expertise, and a human-first brand that cuts through the "blue gradient hexagon" visual noise plaguing the sector. This report covers the full competitive landscape, pricing intelligence, messaging strategy, service architecture, and design direction needed to build number6.ai's brand and website.

## The competitive landscape has a "missing middle" that number6.ai can own

Analysis of 18 AI consulting firms serving SMBs and mid-market companies reveals a fragmented market with no dominant boutique brand. Competitors range from solo operators with Wix sites to mid-size firms with 50+ employees, but most share common weaknesses: vague positioning, hidden pricing, and technology-forward language that alienates non-technical buyers.

**The micro-boutiques (1-5 people)** include MQLFlow (UK, transparent pricing from £800-£4,000 per project, day rate £800), AI SMB Solutions (branded "AI Opportunity Blueprint™" framework, packages $2,500-$7,500), LeadAi Solutions (warm, human-centered tone, "process-first" positioning), and Acuity AI (vendor-neutral advisory, fixed-fee modular pricing). These firms most closely resemble number6.ai's model, and their strongest move is transparent pricing — only two of 18 firms analyzed publish their rates openly.

**The small boutiques (10-30 people)** include Vstorm ("enterprise-grade AI agent solutions at SMB-friendly pricing," specializing in RAG and agentic AI, recognized by Deloitte/EY/Forbes), DataRoot Labs (Kyiv-based, $30-70/hr rates, POCs from $10-15K, projects up to $500K), and Ekipa AI (bold challenger positioning: "Strategy consulting without paying 5 million dollars," offering 24-hour AI roadmaps).

**Mid-size competitors** include AI REV (~51 employees, PhD-level engineers, department-specific AI solutions), InData Labs (~80 employees, 70% mid-market clients), and Centric Consulting (14 US locations, proprietary "Agent C" AI agent framework). Regional players like PennComp in Houston provide local competition — they've served Houston SMBs since 1988 and now offer AI readiness assessments and governance evaluations.

**Key competitive patterns that emerged:**

- Nearly every firm positions against McKinsey/Deloitte/Accenture — "Big Four quality without Big Four budgets" is the universal refrain
- The standard service flow is Assessment → Strategy/Roadmap → Implementation → Training/Support
- Only **2 of 18 firms** publish transparent pricing, creating a significant trust-building opportunity
- Firms that bundle training and enablement with implementation (not just strategy decks) earn the strongest client testimonials
- Proprietary branded frameworks ("AI Opportunity Blueprint™," "Agent C," "AI Readiness Index") are used by the most successful firms to productize their expertise

## Pricing intelligence: what the market actually charges

AI consulting pricing spans an enormous range, but clear benchmarks have emerged for each service type. **Boutique firms typically charge $250-$450/hour**, with senior AI specialists commanding $200-$500/hour and elite consultants (ex-FAANG, PhD, 10+ years) reaching $500-$1,000+/hour. Generative AI specialists command a **20-30% premium** over general AI consultants, and healthcare/finance specialists charge 25-40% more than generalists.

### Project-based pricing by service type

| Service | SMB Range | Mid-Market Range |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| AI Readiness Assessment + Roadmap | $5,000–$25,000 | $25,000–$75,000 |
| AI Training Workshop (half-day) | $2,500–$7,500 | $5,000–$15,000 |
| AI Training Workshop (full-day) | $5,000–$15,000 | $10,000–$25,000 |
| Custom AI Agent (simple) | $5,000–$20,000 | $20,000–$80,000 |
| RAG Knowledge System | $50,000–$150,000 | $100,000–$300,000+ |
| AI Strategy Assessment (comprehensive) | $7,000–$35,000 | $50,000–$150,000 |
| Proof of Concept / Prototype | $10,000–$50,000 | $50,000–$150,000 |

### Retainer models gaining traction

Monthly retainers are the fastest-growing pricing model, with independent consultants securing $2,000-$10,000/month and agencies charging $10,000-$25,000/month. The "Fractional Chief AI Officer" model is emerging as a premium retainer offering, starting at ~$5,000/month for mid-market businesses that can't justify a full-time CAIO (total comp $1M+). Companies like Fifty One Degrees (UK), Prime AI Solutions, and Chief.AI all offer this service.

**The most effective packaging pattern** is a three-tier "journey-based" model that firms report drives **35-40% higher close rates** than hourly billing:

- **Tier 1 — Discovery** ($5K-$15K): AI readiness assessment, use-case identification, roadmap
- **Tier 2 — Pilot** ($15K-$50K): Single use-case implementation, proof of concept
- **Tier 3 — Scale** ($50K-$200K+): Multi-department rollout, integration, training
- **Ongoing — Advisory** ($5K-$15K/month): Fractional CAIO, managed AI services, optimization

**73% of consulting clients now prefer pricing tied to measurable business outcomes** rather than time spent. Value-based pricing (typically 10-25% of financial impact delivered) is the fastest-growing model in the industry. Meanwhile, free AI readiness assessments as lead generation tools convert **30% of leads into paid clients**.

## Messaging that builds trust: what works and what falls flat

The single most effective messaging theme in AI consulting is **practical, anti-hype pragmatism**. MODocs AI captures this perfectly: "Buzzwords shouldn't dictate your roadmap. If a well-placed sensor or simply enforcing existing SOPs will solve the problem faster, we'll tell you. Our goal is sustainable value, not selling hype." This "honest broker" positioning — being willing to say "you may not need AI for this" — builds **enormous trust** with SMB buyers who are fatigued by AI hype.

**The messaging hierarchy that resonates with SMB buyers**, ranked by effectiveness:

1. **Practical/pragmatic AI** — "AI that works for your business, not just looks impressive in a demo"
2. **Outcome-focused language** — Specific numbers ("reduce fraud detection time by 40%") over vague "transformation" promises
3. **Demystifying AI** — 51% of business leaders admit they don't understand how AI fits their needs
4. **Human-centered AI** — "Designing technology that works with people, not replacing them"
5. **Anti-hype honesty** — "We only use AI where it is most useful"

**Language that resonates with SMBs** centers on practical impact: "work smarter, not harder," "level the playing field," "no technical expertise required," "start small, scale as you grow," "free up your time to focus on growth." SMBs think of AI as a tool to compensate for limited staff — "do more with less." They average **4.8 AI tools already in use** but lack strategy connecting them. Their top use cases are marketing, customer service, lead qualification, and content creation.

**Language that loses credibility** includes vague transformative promises ("we reinvent your company with AI," "unlocking AI's potential"), overuse of "cutting-edge" and "revolutionary," and technology-first descriptions without business context. The Visible Authority consultancy advises: replace "We optimize your supply chain with AI-driven insights" with "We help enterprises reduce supply chain risk by 30% by using AI to predict supplier disruptions."

### SMB pain points that number6.ai should directly address

Research across AWS, PayPal, Paychex, SBE Council, and OECD surveys reveals consistent barriers. **Data privacy and security** is the #1 concern (59% cite it as their top barrier). **Skills gap and lack of expertise** affects 50% of SMBs, with 82% of businesses under 5 employees believing AI "isn't applicable" to them. **Uncertain ROI** plagues 34% who don't see a clear use case. Only 23% of heavily promoted AI innovations deliver measurable ROI within year one, feeding skepticism.

The critical insight: **77% of SMBs say marketing and customer engagement are their top areas for new AI solutions**, and **91% of AI-using SMBs say the tools are vital to competitiveness**. The demand exists — the gap is trusted guidance. SMBs want a 90-day ROI window, and 57% rely on managed service providers for AI guidance.

## Service categories: what to offer and how to structure it

### The 2025 service menu for AI consultancies

The standard service architecture clusters into eight categories, which number6.ai should select from based on its strengths:

**AI Strategy & Roadmapping** remains the universal entry point — readiness assessments, use-case discovery, AI maturity evaluation, ROI modeling. **AI Agent / Agentic AI Development** is the hottest category of 2025, with AWS launching dedicated Agentic AI partner categories and Sia consulting creating an "Agent Store" with 400+ agents — though Gartner projects over 40% of agentic AI projects will be canceled by 2027 due to "agent washing." **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Systems** are core to most enterprise AI implementations, with boutique firm Vstorm specializing specifically in RAG for SMBs. **AI Literacy & Training** is surging — the US Department of Labor released an AI Literacy Framework in February 2026 defining five foundational content areas, and 62% of organizations say lack of training is their top barrier to AI adoption. **AI Workflow Automation** has evolved beyond simple RPA to intelligent process automation with LLMs. **AI Governance & Policy** is rising due to the EU AI Act and emerging global regulations. **Data Strategy & Analytics** is the prerequisite foundation layer. **Managed AI Services** provide ongoing model monitoring and optimization on subscription.

**What's becoming commoditized:** basic chatbot development, simple AI proofs-of-concept, and generic strategy reports. The differentiation now comes from production deployment expertise and measurable outcomes.

### Delivery models optimized for a two-person boutique

The recommended hybrid model for a 2-person firm combines five revenue streams:

- **Fractional AI Officer retainers** (1-3 clients at $5K-$10K/month each) provide steady recurring revenue with direct senior access — the boutique advantage over larger firms that assign junior staff
- **Virtual workshops and training** (half-day to 2-day sessions for groups of 10-25) deliver high effective hourly rates ($400-$500/hr) and are highly scalable
- **Productized assessments** (AI readiness audits, workflow analysis) with fixed pricing create repeatable, efficient engagements
- **Cohort-based courses** (quarterly 4-6 week programs at $1,500-$3,000/person) leverage time and build community
- **Async content** (self-paced courses, templates, playbooks) generates passive income — SmarterX and OpenAI Academy are models here

### Certifications and frameworks that signal credibility

The most referenced certifications are **Microsoft Azure AI** (AI-900 Fundamentals, AI-102 Engineer), **Google Cloud** (Professional ML Engineer, Advanced Generative AI Professional), and **AWS** (AI Practitioner, ML Specialty). AI readiness frameworks used by leading firms include Microsoft's 7-pillar model (Business Strategy, AI Governance, Data Foundations, AI Strategy, Organization & Culture, Infrastructure, Model Management), Cisco's 6-dimension AI Readiness Index, and BCG's DRI Framework (Deploy, Reshape, Invent). Developing a proprietary assessment framework — as the most successful boutiques do — would be a strong differentiator for number6.ai.

## Design direction: warm, human, and deliberately anti-cliché

The AI company design landscape in 2025 is dominated by dark mode with colorful accents, gradient-heavy aesthetics, and minimalist layouts. But the most praised brands are the ones breaking these conventions. **Anthropic's warm brown/tan palette with hand-drawn watercolor illustrations is widely cited as the gold standard** for making AI feel approachable and human — a direct rebuke to the cold blue gradients that have become "an eerily identical visual echo chamber" across the industry.

### What makes an AI website trustworthy vs. gimmicky

**Trustworthy signals:** prominent client logos and named testimonials with photos, clear jargon-free language, real product screenshots (not abstract renders), generous whitespace, team photos of actual humans, transparent pricing and process information, and case studies with measurable outcomes.

**Gimmicky red flags:** stock photos of robots or circuit boards, overuse of "AI" buzzwords without substance, heavy animation that distracts from content, purely dark/neon themes that feel like a video game, claims without evidence, and the ubiquitous blue-gradient-hexagon aesthetic that an Ebaq Design analysis found across 100+ AI company logos.

### The color, type, and visual system for number6.ai

**Color palette direction:** Lead with a warm, unexpected primary color — warm amber, terracotta, or a distinctive teal — following Anthropic's playbook of subverting the blue-tech default. Pair with a rich warm dark (charcoal, not pure black) and generous warm off-white. Add a vibrant accent (coral, electric amber, or muted gold) for CTAs. A subtle BSG reference could manifest through muted military-industrial tones (olive, warm grey, deep amber) as tertiary colors — evoking the show's grounded, utilitarian aesthetic without being literal. The "6" in number6.ai is a powerful design element that should anchor the visual identity.

**Typography:** The biggest shift in 2025 is the move from all-sans-serif to **serif + sans-serif pairings** that add warmth and personality. A humanist sans-serif (Söhne, Satoshi, General Sans, or Plus Jakarta Sans) paired with a warm serif (Tiempos, Source Serif, or Fraunces) creates the "modern without coldness" feel. A monospace font (JetBrains Mono or IBM Plex Mono) as a utility face for technical details subtly signals credibility. Bold, confident display headings with lighter body text creates visual dynamism.

**Imagery and visual identity:** Custom illustration (organic, hand-drawn quality — not AI-generated) signals "human" in an AI world. Avoid hexagons, neural networks, and the typical AI visual language. Real team photography creates human connection. The "6" should be treated as a distinctive brand mark, carrying the subtle BSG reference (the Six character) without being overt. Consider scroll-triggered animations that feel purposeful, not showy, and interactive elements that demonstrate AI capability.

### Website structure that converts

The proven homepage flow for AI consulting sites follows this sequence: bold hero headline with primary CTA → client trust bar → problem statement addressing pain points → 3-4 service cards → "How we work" process steps → case studies and bold statistics → team section emphasizing human expertise → thought leadership preview → final CTA → footer. For number6.ai, the name itself invites curiosity — a homepage element addressing "why number 6?" creates engagement and lets the subtle BSG nod land naturally. The site should be light-mode primary (warm off-white) with an optional dark-mode toggle, generous whitespace, and warm color sections breaking up content.

## Strategic synthesis: building number6.ai's competitive advantage

The research converges on a clear strategic position for number6.ai that no current competitor fully occupies: **the honest, practical AI partner for businesses that want results without hype**.

**Five pillars of competitive differentiation:**

- **Transparent pricing** in a market where 89% of competitors hide their rates — this alone builds massive trust with SMB buyers
- **Anti-hype positioning** as the "honest broker" who will tell clients when they don't need AI — counterintuitively the most effective sales message
- **Training + implementation bundled** so AI adoption "actually sticks" rather than creating consultant dependency
- **Transatlantic presence** (Houston + Manchester) is unique among micro-boutiques and enables serving both US and UK/European markets with timezone coverage
- **Proprietary assessment framework** (following the pattern of every successful boutique) branded to number6.ai — this productizes expertise and creates a repeatable entry point

The brand should feel like a knowledgeable friend who happens to be an AI expert — warm, direct, occasionally witty, never patronizing. The visual identity should deliberately break from the cold blue-gradient-hexagon convention with warm colors, serif typography, and hand-drawn illustration. The subtle BSG reference through the name and design details (not overt sci-fi theming) creates an insider culture element that makes the brand memorable without being exclusionary.

The market timing is ideal. **60% of leaders acknowledge an AI literacy skill gap**, **77% of SMBs want AI help with marketing and customer engagement**, and the demand for trusted AI guidance far exceeds the supply of approachable, honest consultants. With productized services, transparent pricing, and a distinctive warm brand, number6.ai can capture the "missing middle" between enterprise-focused giants and shallow solo operators.
